This is a relatively simple A\-N\-S\-I compliant C vector library with specific structures and functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types using a generic structure where the type is passed in as void$\ast$ and stored in a byte array (to avoid dereferencing void$\ast$ warnings and frequent casting) . The generic vector is very flexible and allows you to provide free and init functions if you like that it will call at appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers will call destructors.

Other modifiable parameters are at the top of vector.\-c 
\begin{DoxyPre}
size\_t VEC\_I\_START\_SZ = 50;
size\_t VEC\_D\_START\_SZ = 50;
size\_t VEC\_VOID\_START\_SZ = 20;
size\_t VEC\_S\_START\_SZ = 20;\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}#define \hyperlink{vector__i_8c_a6d9a8fd1aaa4a8df09d79da016a5c5aa}{VEC\_I\_ALLOCATOR(x)} ((x) * 2)
#define \hyperlink{vector__d_8c_a024a194564bd2419ca1ac75e3cdec3e8}{VEC\_D\_ALLOCATOR(x)} ((x) * 2)
#define \hyperlink{vector__str_8c_ac6b46abc3594994ede1811c5268fa72f}{VEC\_STR\_ALLOCATOR(x)} ((x) * 2)
#define \hyperlink{vector__void_8c_a6f86fe931c02dfbb3d901d2f5e5ec969}{VEC\_VOID\_ALLOCATOR(x)} ((x) * 2)
\end{DoxyPre}
 The allocator macros are used in all functions that increase the size by 1. In others (constructors, insert\-\_\-array, reserve) V\-E\-C\-\_\-\-X\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-R\-T\-\_\-\-S\-Z is the amount extra allocated.

There are also 2 templates, one for basic types and one for types that contain dynamically allocated memory and you might want a free and/or init function. In other words the first template is based off \hyperlink{structvector__i}{vector\-\_\-i} and the second is based off of \hyperlink{structvector__void}{vector\-\_\-void}, so look at the corresponding documentation for behavior.

They are located in \hyperlink{vector__template_8c}{vector\-\_\-template.\-c}/h and \hyperlink{vector__template2_8c}{vector\-\_\-template2.\-c}/h respectively.

To use generate your own c and h files for a type just run\-: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
python3 generate\_code.py yourtype
\end{DoxyPre}


which will generate vector\-\_\-yourtype$\ast$.c and vector\-\_\-yourtype$\ast$.h It generates the results for both templates so just delete the pair you don't want.

\hyperlink{structvector__short}{vector\-\_\-short} and \hyperlink{structvector__f__struct}{vector\-\_\-f\-\_\-struct} are examples of the process and how to add it to the testing.\hypertarget{index_Building}{}\section{Building}\label{index_Building}
I use premake so the command on linux is premake4 gmake which will generate a build directory. cd into that and run make or make config=release. I have not tried it on windows though it should work (well I'm not sure about C\-Unit ...).

There is no output of any kind, no errors or warnings.

It has been relatively well tested using Cunit tests which all pass. I've also run it under valgrind and there are no memory leaks.

valgrind --leak-\/check=full -\/v ./vector

You can probably get Cunit from your package manager but if you want to get the most up to date version of C\-Unit go here\-:

\href{http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html}{\tt http\-://cunit.\-sourceforge.\-net/index.\-html} \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/}{\tt http\-://sourceforge.\-net/projects/cunit/}

I used version 2.\-1-\/2.\hypertarget{index_Usage}{}\section{Usage}\label{index_Usage}
To actually use the library just copy vector.\-c and vector.\-h to your project. Also copy in generated types to your project as well. To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should behave, look at \hyperlink{vector__tests_8c}{vector\-\_\-tests.\-c}\hypertarget{index_LICENSE}{}\section{L\-I\-C\-E\-N\-S\-E}\label{index_LICENSE}
