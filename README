=======

This is a relatively simple C vector library with specific structures and
functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types
using a structure for void*.  The void* vector is very flexible and allows
you to provide free and init functions if you like that it will call at
appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers will call destructors.

It has been relatively exhaustively tested
using Cunit tests which all pass, and though I can't guarantee correctness
I'm about 99.9% confident that it functions perfectly.  I've also run it
under valgrind and there are no memory leaks.


I plan to continue to improve/modify it but probably only in minor ways and
only if I think something should be changed.  This library is mostly
for my own use but I thought I would share it and use it as a platform
to learn TDD, CUnit and Doxygen.


I've included the zipped version of CUnit that I used so you can install
and use it to run the tests if you like.


If you want to be sure to get the most up to date version of CUnit go here:

http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/





To actually use the library just copy vector.c and vector.h to your project.
To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should
behave, look at vector_tests.c


Feel free to change/modify and reuse the code however you like.  It'd be nice
to receive some attribution but it's not required.
