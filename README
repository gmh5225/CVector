=======

This is a relatively simple ansi compliant C vector library with specific structures and
functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types
using a structure for bytes.  The byte vector is very flexible and allows
you to provide free and init functions if you like that it will call at
appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers will call destructors.

The compile command is
gcc -ansi -pedantic-errors -Wall -o vector vector.c vector_tests.c main.c -lcunit

and there is no output of any kind, no errors or warnings.


It has been relatively exhaustively tested
using Cunit tests which all pass, and though I can't guarantee correctness
I'm about 99.9% confident that it functions perfectly.  I've also run it
under valgrind and there are no memory leaks.

valgrind --leak-check=yes ./vector
 
==22889== HEAP SUMMARY:
==22889==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==22889==   total heap usage: 4,734 allocs, 4,734 frees, 822,635 bytes allocated
==22889== 
==22889== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible



I plan to continue to improve/modify it but probably only in minor ways and
only if I think something should be changed.  This library is mostly
for my own use but I thought I would share it and use it as a platform
to learn TDD, CUnit and Doxygen.


You can probably get Cunit from your package manager but
if you want to get the most up to date version of CUnit go here:

http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/

I used version 2.1-2.



To actually use the library just copy vector.c and vector.h to your project.
To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should
behave, look at vector_tests.c


Feel free to change/modify and reuse the code however you like.  It'd be nice
to receive some attribution but it's not required.
